<h1>Projects</h1>

<h3><b>Addicted to Fines: A Governing Special Report</b></h3>This project shed light on many local governments’ heavy reliance on fines and court revenues to fund their budgets, an issue that gained national attention following the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., five years ago. No reliable national data exists, so I built a database of revenues compiled from state datasets, scraping websites, records requests and reviewing thousands of individual financial audits. My analysis identified 284 jurisdictions where fines accounted for more than 20 percent of general revenues (the threshold set by Missouri in its post-Ferguson reforms), with select small towns nearly entirely funded by fines. The piece was Governing magazine's final cover story.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/fine-fee-revenues-special-report.html">Summary and findings</a></li><li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-addicted-to-fines.html">Story</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ire.org/archives/39170">IRE podcast</a></li>

<h3><b>Segregated in the Heartland</b></h3>I worked with two other reporters on a series examining segregation in downstate Illinois showing how public policies had effectively reinforced segregation. Our data analysis found residential segregation had largely not improved, while one metro area recorded the highest level of school segregation in the country. The series prompted interest from local officials and media across the state.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-segregation-series.html">Project page</a></li>

<h3><b>Where Police Don't Mirror Communities and Why It Matters</b></h3>I analyzed police personnel data and Census population estimates to show racial minorities were underrepresented by a combined 24 percentage points on average in U.S. cities. An accompanying data interactive illustrates results for hundreds of police departments.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-police-department-diversity.html">Story</a></li><li><a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/police-department-officer-demographics-minority-representation.html">Data interactive</a></li>

<h3><b>Pedestrians Dying at Disproportionate Rates in America's Poorer Neighborhoods</b></h3>I conducted a spatial analysis using geographic coordinates of pedestrian deaths reported in a federal database to show how fatality rates in low-income neighborhoods were double that of higher-income areas. The report – the first such national analysis – was cited in a speech by then-Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, numerous news outlets and in later federal DOT policy guidance.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-pedestrian-deaths-analysis.html">Story</a></li>

<h3><b>Building Homes in Flood Zones: Why Does This Bad Idea Keep Happening?</b></h3>I computed population growth estimates for FEMA-designated flood zones to illustrate the alarming rate of development in flood-prone regions of the country. The story profiled one such development in Charleston, S.C.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-flood-zone-floodplain-development-homes-zoning.html">Story</a></li><li><a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/census/flood-plains-zone-local-population-growth-data.html">Data analysis</a></li>
