<h2>Mike Maciag's Portfolio</h2>
<br>
	

<h3><b>Whose Park Is It, Anyway?</b></h3>For this piece, I profiled the Adirondack Park in New York and the longstanding competing interests of development and conservation.<li><a href="https://mwmaciag.github.io/Adirondacks.pdf">Story</a></li>

<h3><b>Addicted to Fines: A Governing Special Report</b></h3>This project shed light on many local governments’ heavy reliance on fines and court revenues to fund their budgets, an issue that gained national attention following the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., several years ago. No reliable national data exists, so I built a database of revenues compiled from state datasets, scraping websites, records requests and reviewing thousands of individual financial audits. My analysis identified 284 jurisdictions where fines accounted for more than 20 percent of general revenues (the threshold set by Missouri in its post-Ferguson reforms), with select small towns nearly entirely funded by fines. The piece, Governing magazine's final cover story, has been heavily cited in national media, court filings, and academic studies.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/fine-fee-revenues-special-report.html">Project page</a></li><li><a href="https://mwmaciag.github.io/Addicted_to_Fines.pdf">Magazine story</a></li>

<h3><b>Building Homes in Flood Zones: Why Does This Bad Idea Keep Happening?</b></h3>I analyzed population data for FEMA-designated flood zones to illustrate the alarming rate of development in flood-prone regions. My analysis found that neighborhoods in floodplains collectively experienced greater population growth than other areas of the country. The story profiled one such development in Charleston, S.C.<li><a href="https://mwmaciag.github.io/RiskyWaters.pdf">Story</a></li>

<h3><b>Segregated in the Heartland</b></h3>I worked with two other reporters on a series examining segregation in downstate Illinois showing how public policies had effectively reinforced segregation. My data analysis found residential segregation had largely not improved, while one metro area recorded the highest level of school segregation in the country. Our series prompted interest from local officials and media across the state.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-segregation-series.html">Project page</a></li>
		
<h3><b>Pedestrians Dying at Disproportionate Rates in America's Poorer Neighborhoods</b></h3>I conducted a spatial analysis using geographic coordinates of pedestrian deaths reported in a federal database to show how fatality rates in low-income neighborhoods were double that of higher-income areas. The report – the first such national analysis – detailed several dangerous corridors for pedestrians and discussed factors contributing to the disparities. It was cited in a speech by then-Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, numerous news outlets and in later federal DOT policy guidance.<li><a href="https://mwmaciag.github.io/Mean_Streets.pdf">Story</a></li>
