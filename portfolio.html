<h1>Projects and Magazine Features</h1>

<h3><b>Addicted to Fines: A Governing Special Report</b></h3>This project sheds light on local governments relying heavily on fines and court revenues to fund their budgets, an issue that gained national attention following the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., five years ago. No reliable national data exists, so I built a database of revenues compiled from state datasets, records requests and reviewing thousands of individual financial audits. My analysis identified 284 jurisdictions where fines accounted for more than 20 percent of general revenues (the threshold set by Missouri in its post-Ferguson reforms), with select small towns nearly entirely funded by fines. The piece was Governing's final cover story.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/fine-fee-revenues-special-report.html">Summary and findings</a></li><li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-addicted-to-fines.html">Magazine article</a></li>

<h3><b>Building Homes in Flood Zones: Why Does This Bad Idea Keep Happening?</b></h3>I computed population growth estimates for FEMA-designated flood zones to illustrate the alarming rate of development in flood-prone regions of the country. The story profiled one such development in Charleston, S.C.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-flood-zone-floodplain-development-homes-zoning.html">Article</a></li><li><a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/census/flood-plains-zone-local-population-growth-data.html">Data analysis</a></li>

<h3><b>Pedestrians Dying at Disproportionate Rates in America's Poorer Neighborhoods</b></h3>I conducted a spatial analysis using geographic coordinates of pedestrian deaths reported in a federal database to show how fatality rates in low-income neighborhoods were double that of higher-income areas. The report – the first such national analysis – was cited in a speech by then-Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, numerous news outlets and in later federal DOT policy guidance.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-pedestrian-deaths-analysis.html">Article</a></li><li><a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/pedestrian-deaths-poor-neighborhoods-report.html">Report summary</a></li>

<h3><b>Segregated in the Heartland</b></h3>I worked with two other reporters on a series examining segregation in downstate Illinois showing how policies had effectively reinforced segregation. Our data analysis found residential segregation had not improved in several cities. Additionally, one metro area recorded the highest level of school segregation in the country.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-segregation-series.html">Project page</a></li>
