<h1>Projects</h1>

<h3><b>Addicted to Fines: A Governing Special Report</b></h3>I wanted to investigate where local governments rely heavily on fines and court revenues to fund their budgets, an issue that gained national attention following the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., five years ago. No reliable national data exists, so I built a database of revenues compiled from state datasets, records requests and reviewing thousands of individual financial audits. My analysis showed that for at least 284 jurisdictions, fines accounted for more than 20 percent of general revenues (the threshold set by Missouri in its post-Ferguson reforms), with select towns nearly entirely funded by fines.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/fine-fee-revenues-special-report.html">Summary and findings</a></li><li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-addicted-to-fines.html">Magazine article</a></li>


<h3><b>Building Homes in Flood Zones: Why Does This Bad Idea Keep Happening?</b></h3>This story details how development continues to take place in flood-prone areas of the country, featuring one area of Charleston, S.C. I computed population growth estimates for FEMA-designated flood zones to illustrate the severity of the problem nationally.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-flood-zone-floodplain-development-homes-zoning.html">Article</a></li><li><a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/census/flood-plains-zone-local-population-growth-data.html">Data analysis</a></li>
<h3><b>Pedestrians Dying at Disproportionate Rates in America's Poorer Neighborhoods</b></h3>I conducted a spatial analysis using geographic coordinates of pedestrian deaths reported in a federal database to show how fatality rates in low-income neighborhoods were double that of higher-income areas. The report – the first such national analysis – was cited in a speech by then-Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, numerous news outlets and in later federal DOT policy guidance.<li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-pedestrian-deaths-analysis.html">Article</a></li><li><a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/pedestrian-deaths-poor-neighborhoods-report.html">Report summary</a></li>

<h3><b>Segregated in the Heartland</b></h3>I worked with two reporters on a series examining segregation in downstate Illinois, highlighting how policies had effectively reinforced segregation. Our data analysis found residential segregation had not improved in several cities and one metro area, Peoria, had the highest level of school segregation nationally.<li><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-segregation-series.html">Project page</a></li>

<h3><b>Where Police Don't Mirror Communities and Why It Matters</b></h3>For this report, I analyzed police personnel data and Census population estimates to show racial and ethnic minorities were underrepresented by a combined 24 percentage points on average in U.S. cities. <li><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-police-department-diversity.html">Article</a></li><li><a href="http://images.centerdigitaled.com/documents/policediversityreport.pdf">Report with full results</a></li>
